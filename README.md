# PSCFA
Identification of multi-functional therapeutic peptides based on prototypical supervised contrastive learning
##  Introduction
In this paper, we propose PSCFA, a prototypical supervised contrastive learning with feature augmentation method for prediction of MFTP.The contributions of this work can be outlined as follows:  
(1)We propose a novel two-stage network structure for identification of MFTP, demonstrating that improved feature representation can facilitate better classifier learning. The network incorporates of a total loss function, integrated both contrastive loss and dice loss for feature learning, complemented by a dice loss for classifier learning.   
(2)We explore an effective prototypical supervised contrastive learning strategies to refine feature learning to boost classification performance for MFTP.  
(3)The feature augmentation strategy for tail labels can effectively improve classification performance of the model on classes with limited instances.  
(4)Our experimental results conclusively show that PSCFA consistently outperforms current leading methods when evaluated on MFTP datasets, underscoring its efficacy and superiority in the domain of computational peptide analysis.  

The framework of the PSCFA method for MFTP prediction is described as follows:

## Installation
- **Requirements**

    OS:  
     - **Windows**: Windows 10 or later  
     - **Linux**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or later

    Python Environmentï¼š    
    Ensure your Python environment is compatible with the specified library versions:  
    - `Python= 3.8.17`
    - `pytorch=1.13.1`
    - `cuda=11.7`
    - `numpy=1.24.3`
    - `pandas=2.0.3`
    - `tqdm=4.65.0`
    - `scikit-learn=1.3.2`
- **Download `PSCFA` to your computer:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nst1211/PSCFA.git
   ```
##  The Training and test of the PSCFA model  
   ```bash
   cd PSCFA-main
   ```
1.Feature learning stage:
   ```bash
   python pep_main.py --pretrained=False --FA=False
   ```
2.Classifier learning stage:
   ```bash
   python pep_main.py --pretrained=True --FA=True
   ```
##  Prediction
After getting the trained model, we can use it to recognize new peptide sequences. First make sure you have prepared a FASTA file (test.fasta) containing the peptide sequence, run predictor.py,the script will read and encode the sequence, then load the pre-trained PSCFA model to predict the function of the sequence. The prediction results will be saved to the specified output folder.
